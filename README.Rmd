* more nuanced `verbose` option
* logging into rflow object
* handling of obsolete nodes
  * removing objects from DAG
  * removing cache
  * removing node config files
  * deleting represented objects

  * currently, if a property is deleted update() method ignores it
* query function to set or get fields of multiple objects
* documentation
* quick start guide
* allow Python and Julia code
* new node types:
  * test node
* Rflow manager as a Shiny app

**Implementation**

* experiment with proper ORM instead of serialization of selected properties 
* SQL execution by a generic R function instead of metaprogramming
  * solves potential problems with escaping quotes in SQL code
* environments as R6 classes
* generic methods in node class for initializing and updating properties
* more unit tests
* make all public properties active (trigger persistence storage)
